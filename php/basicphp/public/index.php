 * BasicPHP - A frameworkless library-based approach for building web applications
 *          - and application programming interfaces or API's.
 *          - The aim of the project is for developers to build applications that are
 *          - framework-independent using vanilla PHP, and native functions and API's.
 *          -
 *          - To embed the application to any framework, copy BasicPHP's configuration
 *          - file (config.php), functions library (Basic.php), and the 'classes',
 *          - 'models', 'views' and 'controllers' folders one (1) folder above the front
 *          - controller file of the chosen framework. In the controller file, at the
 *          - top of the script, include/require config.php and Basic.php.
